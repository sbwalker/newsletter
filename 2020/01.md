## Foundation Updates

The board has decided to hold its meetings on the third Thursday of every month. The next board meeting is scheduled for 2/20. At the last meeting, the board discussed the current action group structure and decided to narrow focus. The new committees will be:

* Membership - processing new member applications and setting membership policies
* Projects - project support requests and processing new project applications
* Outreach - anything that touches the broader community, from members to sponsors, speakers, meetup groups
* Marketing 

The board is working to define a charter and specifics of how each committee will be run. Please participate with the committees by joining them here https://github.com/orgs/dotnet-foundation/teams.

## Committee Updates

Projects - Revising our processes for committee participation, reviewing new project applications, onboarding approved projects, and monitoring health of Foundation projects. Working through onboarding tasks for the backlog of recently accepted projects.

### [NUnit](https://nunit.org/)

This month brought releases for two of our projects:

**NUnit VSTest Adapter 3.16.0** ([release notes](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Adapter-Release-Notes#nunit3-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-3160---january-3-2020)) and **3.16.1** ([release notes](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Adapter-Release-Notes#nunit3-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-3161---january-16-2020)). Major changes in 3.16:

- Support has been removed for .NET Core 1.* which is no longer supported by Microsoft. If you do have .NET Core 1.* solutions and can't upgrade, you should stay with version 3.15.1 or lower of the adapter.

- The filter syntax issues we've had with special names and characters have been mostly solved thanks to excellent work by [John M. Wright](https://github.com/johnmwright). See [PR 668](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/668) for a detailed explanation of what has been done.

- You can now use the NUnit filter syntax, either from command line or through settings in the runsettings file. The idea and implementation were provided by [Michael Letterle](https://github.com/mletterle) who wrote a [great blogpost](http://blog.prokrams.com/2019/12/16/nunit3-filter-dotnet/) to explain how this works and how he arrived at the solution.

**NUnit Console and Engine 3.11** ([release notes](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Console-Release-Notes#nunit-console-311---january-26-2020)). This release fixes a range of minor bugs and includes a significant amount of internal restructuring work. In future, this will enable improved .NET Standard support in the engine and a .NET Core build of the console.

### [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)

From the Polly community this month: 

Updates to **Simmy** ([github](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Simmy); [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.Simmy)), our sister project for **chaos-engineering integrated with Polly**.  Version 0.3 released:

- New Fluent-builder syntax for easier configuration
- .NET Core 3.1 support

**Polly.Contrib.DuplicateRequestCollapser** ([github](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.DuplicateRequestCollapser); [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.DuplicateRequestCollapser/)): a new Polly policy to [avoid downstream request storms](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Avoiding-cache-repopulation-request-storms) when repopulating expensive cache items in high-throughput systems.  `Polly.Contrib.DuplicateRequestCollapser` [collapses concurrent duplicate requests into a single downstream call](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.DuplicateRequestCollapser/blob/master/README.md).
